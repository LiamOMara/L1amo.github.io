					<h3>Mission Goal</h3>
					<p>
                        A team of graduate researchers and ASU staff are working to develop a small space telescope
                        with the mission of monitoring the flares and sunspot activity of M-type stars. 
                        SPARCS will be ready for launch by the end of 2023 to a Sun-synchronous orbit.

					<h3>My Part in This</h3>
					<p>
                        I was responsible for designing different jigs used to test optics in the CubeSat. 
						The components I modeled and drafted were machined professionally by the ASU Machine and Electrical Shop. 
							<br> <br>
						Currently, I'm assisting in the preparation / execution of experiments meant to test spacecraft hardware. 
						This is being done in an ISO 5 cleanroom and involves multistep part cleaning in and outside of the cleanroom. 

							<br> <br>
						Through this experience, I've gained insight in the practical applications and limits to 
						CAD modelling and drafting, as well as important practices to adhere to when
						designing parts. I'm also gaining valuable experience working in a clearnroom as an optomechanical engineer.
